## Introduction

Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project, which is about setting up a honeynet in Azure to mimic real cyber attacks. This project shows off my skills in keeping Azure secure, handling incidents, and making the environment stronger.

## Objective

The main goal of this project was to create virtual machines in Azure that are easy to attack on purpose. This way, I could attract and study cyber attacks. Doing this helped me learn how attackers think and act, and it also proved that I can deal with security problems fast and well.

## Technologies, Regulations, and Azure Components Employed:

- Azure Virtual Network (VNet)
- Azure Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2x Windows, 1x Linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace with Kusto Query Language (KQL) Queries
- Azure Key Vault for Secure Secrets Management
- Azure Storage Account for Data Storage
- Microsoft Sentinel for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud to Protect Cloud Resources
- Windows Remote Desktop for Remote Access
- Command Line Interface (CLI) for System Management
- PowerShell for Automation and Configuration Management
- NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 for Security Controls
- NIST SP 800-61 Revision 2 for Incident Handling Guidance

## Methodology

#### Setting up the honeynet: 
I started by setting up several virtual machines in Azure that were easy to hack, to create a not-so-secure setup.

#### Watching and studying: 
I set up Azure to collect logs from different sources into one place for analysis. Then, I used Microsoft Sentinel to make visual maps of attacks, set off alerts, and note down any incidents from the data.

#### Measuring security: 
For a day, I kept an eye on how secure the environment was, noting down important security details. This gave me a starting point to see how things improved after I fixed the problems.

#### Handling incidents and making things secure: 
Once I took care of the incidents and found out where the weak spots were, I made the environment stronger by following the best security practices and advice specific to Azure.

#### Checking things after fixing them: 
After making everything secure, I watched the environment for another day to check the security details again. This helped me see how much things had improved compared to before.


## Methodology
### Architecture before implementing Hardening Measures and Security Controls

Prior to the implementation of hardening strategies and security protocols:

During the initial phase, addressed as "BEFORE," resources were deliberately made publicly accessible online. This configuration was designed to be vulnerable to lure cyber assailants and study their methods. The **Virtual Machines** were set up with completely open **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** and deactivated internal firewalls, permitting free entry from all origins. Furthermore, every other asset, including **storage accounts** and **databases**, was established with public-facing internet endpoints, foregoing the use of any **Private Endpoints** to enhance security.

## Conclusion

In summary, this project involved setting up a small-scale honeynet within Microsoft Azure, using virtual machines and a Security Operations Center (SOC) that included Log Analytics, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and Microsoft Sentinel. Sentinel was responsible for processing the logs from Log Analytics to generate alerts and incidents. Initially, the environment was monitored without security enhancements, and data was gathered based on predefined security metrics. Afterward, Microsoft Defender's recommended security measures were put into place. A subsequent analysis of the logs and data showed a significant decrease in the number of security-related events and incidents post-implementation.

It should be noted that in a scenario where the network's resources are extensively used by regular users, it's possible that an increased volume of security events and alerts could be observed within the first 24 hours after the security controls have been enforced. (screenshots will be added)
