# Honey-Net-Project


## Introduction

Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project, which is about setting up a honeynet in Azure to mimic real cyber attacks. This project shows off my skills in keeping Azure secure, handling incidents, and making the environment stronger.

## Objective

The main goal of this project was to create virtual machines in Azure that are easy to attack on purpose. This way, I could attract and study cyber attacks. Doing this helped me learn how attackers think and act, and it also proved that I can deal with security problems fast and well.
